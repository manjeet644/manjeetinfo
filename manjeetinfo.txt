	Leyer:7 The application layer 
 The topmost layer of the OSI model is the application layer. This layer interacts with given data directly that Is received from the user. This layer gives File Transfer Access and Management, which enables a user to access, retrieve, manage or control files in a  computer.
	Leyer:6 The presentation layer 
The main of role of this layer is that it prepares data that can used by application layer. This layer is responsible for encryption and translation of data and compression of that data that has to be transferred to application layer.
	Leyer:5 The Session Layer 
The session layer ensures that the communication between the two devices stays open and closes according to time so that there is minimal wastage of resources .
	Leyer:4 The transport layer 
This layer helps in forming end to end connection. It takes data from the session layer and then finally breaks it into various chunks which are called segments and then reassembles it to data that can consume later on by session layer .
	Leyer:3 The Network layer 
The main function of the network layer is to transfer packets from source to destination across multiple networks. There is no need for this layer if two systems are connected on the same network. This  network layer also finds the best possible  physical path for the data to reach its destination which is commonly  known as routing.
	Leyer:2 The data link layer 
The main function of a data-link layer is to handle the errors which might occur at the physical layer. The data-link layer is accountable for node-to-node delivery of the data .
	Leyer:1 The physical layer 
The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. The physical layer describes the electrical and physical specifications of the data connection.
